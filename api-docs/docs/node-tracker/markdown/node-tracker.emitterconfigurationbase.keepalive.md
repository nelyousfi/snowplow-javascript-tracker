## EmitterConfigurationBase.keepalive property

Indicates that the request should be allowed to outlive the webpage that initiated it. Enables collector requests to complete even if the page is closed or navigated away from. Note: Browsers put a limit on keepalive requests of 64KB. In case of multiple keepalive requests in parallel (may happen in case of multiple trackers), the limit is shared.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
keepalive?: boolean;
```
